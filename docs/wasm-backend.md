# The CNA-TS WebAssembly backend

TypeScript's most valuable environment is the browser, and this is the backend that gets there. The
public API does not change: `Game`, `GraphicsDeviceManager`, `Texture2D`, `SpriteBatch` and the
input snapshots are the same `Microsoft.Xna.Framework` classes a Node consumer uses. What differs is
only which object answers the private backend boundary.

```js
import { LoadWasmBackend, Game, GraphicsDeviceManager, Color } from "cna-ts";
const createCnaCApi = (await import("./cna_c_api.mjs")).default;
await LoadWasmBackend({ Factory: createCnaCApi, FactoryOptions: { canvas } });
```

## What is proved, and what is not

```text
BROWSER_BUNDLE=NOT_APPLICABLE (the harness serves the built package directly, no bundler)
BROWSER_RUNTIME=PASS
BROWSER_FRAMES_60=PASS
BROWSER_FRAMES_600=PASS
BROWSER=headless Chromium via Playwright, SwiftShader
CONTEXT=WebGL 2.0 (OpenGL ES 3.0)
CNA_RENDERER=WEBGL2 through EasyGL
ABI=0.20.0
WASM_BACKEND_ROUTES=105
MISSING_WASM_BACKEND_EXPORTS=0
UNCAUGHT_PAGE_ERRORS=0
```

Every one of those 105 routes is resolved when the backend is constructed, so a module missing any of
them fails at load rather than mid-frame; `npm run audit:cna-abi` checks the same list against the
artifact's loader before a browser is started.

`npm run test:wasm-browser` serves `dist/` and the artifact over HTTP, drives an ordinary XNA `Game`
from `requestAnimationFrame`, and asserts the frame, update and draw counts, the texture the game
created, deterministic disposal and an empty page-error list. A page that merely *builds* is not
evidence of a runtime, so nothing here is claimed from a successful bundle.

This is a **vertical slice**, not the whole boundary. Every member outside it refuses by name --
through the generated `CnaBackendBase` for the game boundary and `CnaGraphicsBackendBase` for the
device's own -- rather than pretending to work, so a consumer reaching past the slice gets a
diagnostic naming the member instead of a silent wrong answer.

In the slice: ABI query, initialization, game create/run-one-frame/exit/destroy,
graphics-device-manager configuration and device creation, renderer identity, `Clear`, `Texture2D`
create/upload/read/destroy, `SpriteBatch` begin/submit/end/destroy, keyboard and mouse snapshots,
the modern runtime-services family, **title storage**, **render targets**, and **sound effects**.

## Sound

A game without sound is not much of a game, so `SoundEffect` and `SoundEffectInstance` are the same
public classes here that a Node consumer uses. What a browser adds is one rule this backend does not
pretend away: a page will not start a WebAudio context until it has had a user gesture. So building
a sound, reading its duration, making instances and driving their state all work regardless, and
whether a sample is *audible* is the page's business. `SoundEffect.Play` reports whether the runtime
accepted it, which is the most a caller can truthfully be told from here.

```text
DURATION=250 ms exactly, from a quarter second of 8 kHz mono PCM
INSTANCE_STATES=Stopped -> Playing -> Paused -> Playing -> Stopped
VOLUME/PITCH/PAN/LOOPED=round-trip at float precision
```

Duration is arithmetic on the sample count, so it is exact evidence that does not depend on anything
being heard. XACT, microphones, 3D positioning and dynamic buffers are outside the slice and refuse
by name.

## Content in a browser

A browser game's assets have to reach the module's filesystem, because that is what CNA reads.
`TitleContainer.OpenStream` and therefore `ContentManager.Load` work in a page once they are there:

```js
const module = await createCnaCApi({ canvas });
module.FS.mkdir("/Content");
module.FS.writeFile("/Content/Atlas.xnb", new Uint8Array(await (await fetch("/Atlas.xnb")).arrayBuffer()));
await LoadWasmBackend({ Module: module });
// ...then, inside the Game, the ordinary XNA call:
const atlas = new Content.ContentManager(this.Services, "Content").Load(Graphics.Texture2D, "Atlas");
```

Nothing about `ContentManager` is browser-specific: XNB framing, the reader table, the LZX
decompressor and every built-in reader graph are managed TypeScript and already ran on Node. What
the browser needed was the one route underneath them. `cna_title_container_read_ext` is a
count/copy pair delivering a whole file, so the backend probes for the size, copies once, and
releases the module allocation before returning -- the bytes a consumer holds are a JavaScript copy,
never a pointer into a heap that `ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH` can move. A missing asset is
`CNA_RESULT_IO`, which surfaces as a failure rather than as an empty asset.

Loading content inside a `Game` also needed a behavioural fix that had nothing to do with
WebAssembly: `GraphicsDeviceManager`'s constructor now registers itself in `Game.Services`, as XNA's
does under `IGraphicsDeviceService`/`IGraphicsDeviceManager`. The built-in texture, font and model
readers look for exactly that, and without it `Content.Load` inside an ordinary `Game` failed on
either backend. A TypeScript interface has no runtime token to key a service by, so the concrete
class is the key.

## Off-screen rendering, and the first asserted pixels

`RenderTarget2D` is the whole reason the graphics boundary got its own facade here. A browser test
can now clear a target to an exact colour and read every texel back:

```text
RENDER_TARGET=4x4 DepthFormat.None DiscardContents
CLEAR=(12, 34, 56, 255)
READBACK=16 of 16 texels exactly equal
BOUND_DISPOSAL=refused ("A bound RenderTarget2D cannot be disposed")
```

That is the first evidence in this project that comes out of a GPU rather than out of a route
returning success: the bind, the clear, the unbind and the readback all have to reach real WebGL2
storage for those sixteen values to be right.

`ContentLost` is deliberately **not** implemented on this backend. `render_target.h` says only the
`DIRECTX9`, `DIRECT2D` and `SKIA` families can report a lost device, so a WebGL2 subscription would
be valid and permanently silent. The managed helper already treats a refused subscription as "this
renderer cannot lose a device", which is what XNA does, so the honest answer is to leave the event
declared and unproduced rather than to register a producer that can never fire.

## Building the artifact

The artifact is `cna_c_api.mjs` plus `cna_c_api.wasm`, from the `cna_c_api_wasm` target of an
Emscripten tree. Out of tree, and with two link settings the target does not set itself:

```sh
source ~/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
emcmake cmake -S . -B cmake-build-tswasm -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCNA_BUILD_C_API=ON \
  -DCNA_SHARP_RUNTIME_ROOT=/path/to/sharp-runtimenext \
  -DCNA_GRAPHICS_RENDERER=WEBGL2 \
  -DCNA_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DCNA_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF \
  -DCNA_ENABLE_DRACO=OFF -DCNA_ENABLE_VIDEO=OFF \
  -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-sMIN_WEBGL_VERSION=2 -sMAX_WEBGL_VERSION=2" \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_LIBRARIES="-sASYNCIFY=0" \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache
cmake --build cmake-build-tswasm --target cna_c_api_wasm
```

The artifact this build produces, requalified against `cnanext` 17b5a90a:

```text
EMCC=6.0.3
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release   CNA_GRAPHICS_RENDERER=WEBGL2   CNA_PLATFORM=SDL3
MODULE_SHA256=70eea48caddb9bdf94f47a7edac49506678c95a574cd4506bd1a847656522e3f
WASM_SHA256=6a5db6f6a6a3cc4e0906c0e108d31e850adf75b65ea805c1b8c99b7e30ff49f2
WASM_BYTES=18943981
EXPOSED_ROUTES=4053
```

Both extra settings exist because of measured upstream gaps, recorded below. Each was re-checked
against the live `cnanext` tree on 2026-08-31 and both are still present: `cna_c_api_wasm`'s
`target_link_options` in `modules/c-api/CMakeLists.txt` still set no `MIN_WEBGL_VERSION` or
`MAX_WEBGL_VERSION`, and `cna_emscripten_abi` in `cmake/BuildPerformance.cmake` still adds
`-sASYNCIFY=1` to every Emscripten link unconditionally. Neither workaround has been removed on the
strength of the build merely continuing to succeed with it. `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_LIBRARIES`
is the placement that works: CMake puts `CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS` *before* a target's own link
options, and `emcc` lets the last `-s` win, so an `-sASYNCIFY=0` in the linker flags would be
overridden by the `-sASYNCIFY=1` the target inherits.

## Upstream gaps this backend measured

### 1. `cna_c_api_wasm` does not pin the WebGL version its renderer needs

Without `-sMIN_WEBGL_VERSION=2 -sMAX_WEBGL_VERSION=2`, Emscripten negotiates a WebGL 1 context while
`EasyGLGraphicsBackend` asks SDL for GLES 3, its GLSL ES 3.00 shaders fail to compile
(`ERROR: 0:1: '' : unsupported shader version 300`), and the module aborts on the first draw.
`cnanext/docs/web-emscripten-graphics-limitations.md` already records this exact failure for a
different target, and `modules/graphics/examples/CMakeLists.txt` sets the pair for the demos --
`cna_c_api_wasm`, the artifact a binding is meant to consume, does not.

**Proposed upstream change:** give `cna_c_api_wasm` the same renderer-conditional
`MIN_WEBGL_VERSION`/`MAX_WEBGL_VERSION` link options the examples already carry.

### 2. `-sASYNCIFY=1` makes every route unrewindable, because every route takes a handle

`CNA::EmscriptenAbi` adds `-sASYNCIFY=1` to every Emscripten link. SDL3's
`Emscripten_GLES_SwapWindow` then calls `emscripten_sleep(0)` on each present
(`third_party/SDL/src/video/emscripten/SDL_emscriptenopengles.c:145`, guarded by
`emscripten_has_asyncify()`), which unwinds the JS-entered export.

Asyncify's rewind re-enters the bottom export of the call stack **with no arguments**. Under
`WASM_BIGINT` an `i64` parameter given `undefined` throws
`TypeError: Cannot convert undefined to a BigInt`, so the rewind fails and the frame is lost. Every
route in this ABI takes a `CNA_Handle`, which is `uint64_t`, so **no route can be driven from
JavaScript while Asyncify may unwind it**. Measured: with Asyncify on, 5 requested frames produced 3
updates and 3 unhandled rejections; with `-sASYNCIFY=0`, 5 frames produced 5 updates, 5 draws and no
errors.

**Proposed upstream change:** either link `cna_c_api_wasm` with `-sASYNCIFY=0`, or set
`SDL_HINT_EMSCRIPTEN_ASYNCIFY` to false inside the C API's platform initialisation. The first is
correct for a library whose consumer owns the event loop; the second keeps Asyncify for consumers
who want a blocking `cna_game_run`.

## Frame pacing in a browser

`Game.Run` refuses on this backend, and that refusal is the honest answer: a browser owns its event
loop and a blocking loop would freeze the page. Drive `Game.RunOneFrame` from
`requestAnimationFrame`.

Set `IsFixedTimeStep = false` for a browser game. With a fixed timestep, CNA's `Game::Tick` waits out
the remainder of each frame through `Platform::Delay`, and without Asyncify that is a busy wait
inside the page's own frame callback. `requestAnimationFrame` is already the display's clock, so the
variable timestep is both correct and what the browser wants.

## What the layout module is for

`src/internal/wasm/layout.ts` is generated by `tools/wasm/generate-layout.mjs` from a probe compiled
by the same Emscripten toolchain that builds the artifact. wasm32 pointers are four bytes, so the
native ABI baseline places several structure fields somewhere the module does not look --
`docs/c-api/WASM_ARTIFACT.md` names hand-rolling `CNA_GameCreateInfo` from the native layout as
exactly how a binding earns `CNA_RESULT_INVALID_ARGUMENT` with nothing visibly wrong. Nothing in that
file is written by hand, and the sprite-command array stride is read from it rather than restated,
which is what caught an assumed 80-byte stride against a measured 72.

## A wasm32 convention this backend pinned

`docs/c-api/WASM_ARTIFACT.md` records that how a `CNA_StringView` passed **by value** is expanded in
the wasm32 calling convention "was not established", and advises using pointer-and-length routes
where there is a choice. Three routes this binding needs offer no choice --
`cna_graphics_renderer_set_preferred_by_name_ext`, `cna_graphics_renderer_try_parse_name_ext` and
`cna_logger_log` all take the view by value.

Measured: Emscripten lowers the by-value aggregate to **a pointer to the structure in module
memory**, laid out exactly as the generated `CNA_StringView` layout says. The browser test asserts
the round trip -- `TryParseName("webgl2")` returns 6 and `TryParseName("not-a-renderer")` returns
null -- so a wrong lowering would fail rather than pass quietly. That is one fewer unpinned item in
the artifact contract.

## Two states this backend learned to model

Both were found by running the same code on two backends, which is the point of having two.

- **`cna_graphics_renderer_get_active_ext` refuses before any renderer exists**, with
  `CNA_RESULT_INVALID_STATE` and the message "was called before any graphics renderer had been
  created". That is a state, not a failure, so `RendererSelectionState.Active` is `null` there
  rather than an exception or a fabricated `Unknown`.
- **`cna_desktop_os_get_current` refuses off a desktop**, which is exactly what a browser is. Node
  reaches this route happily and would never have shown it; the browser run failed on the first
  call. `CnaPlatformInfo.DesktopOperatingSystem` is now `null` on a non-desktop platform.
