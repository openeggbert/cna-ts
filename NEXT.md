## 2026-08-22: canonical TypeScript consolidation

### Repository invariants

- `cna-ts` started clean at `553fe713e3de61d5a7a35296b84e2b7184328100`.
- `cna-ts-template` started clean at `6b6b533e0816dd15d8bc06088b23a0d84287ac96`.
- read-only `cna-js` started clean at `bcd6ee1effef38846af0883b6f93d3b137bb06cf`.
- read-only `cna-js-template` started clean at
  `bc88cc766929bff1743405b47cf3d9f58e46e39a`.
- `cna-cs` and `cna-java` already contained unrelated uncommitted work and were read only.

### Evidence gathered

- Legacy CNA-JS runtime source/tests matched the pre-conversion CNA-TS implementation; no unique
  binding code was found.
- Both templates carry the identical logo asset; the legacy JS template has no unique runtime.
- The actual CNA headers report C ABI 0.7.0. A declaration scan found 59 headers and 2,861 unique
  `CNA_C_API` functions.
- CNA contains Emscripten-aware platform/renderers and prior WebAssembly build evidence, but no
  packaged CNA C-ABI ESM loader/Wasm artifact was present and `emcc` was unavailable locally.
- The selected seven XNA assemblies matched the hashes recorded by the sibling verifier.
- Reflection extraction from those assemblies reported `REFERENCE_TYPES=257` and
  `REFERENCE_MEMBERS=2964`.

### Delivered and pushed

Commit `714336d` converts runtime ownership to TypeScript, pins TypeScript 5.9.2, emits ESM and
generated declarations/maps to `dist`, adds package subpaths, introduces tick-precise `TimeSpan`,
repairs initial value mutability/names, and adds runtime-independent tests/type probes.

Local verification used the official Node.js 22.14.0 Linux archive after matching its published
SHA-256:

```text
tsc -p tsconfig.json                 PASS
tsc -p tsconfig.types.json           PASS
node --test                          PASS (6 tests)
npm pack --dry-run --ignore-scripts  PASS (61 files at this checkpoint)
git diff --check                     PASS
```

### Immediate next gates

The CLR extractor/profile, TypeScript-AST verifier, runtime-symbol verifier, and leak gate landed in
the next thematic change. Its first report-only baseline is:

```text
REFERENCE_TYPES=257
REFERENCE_MEMBERS=2964
EXPECTED_MAPPED_TYPES=264
TARGET_TYPES=7
TOTAL_DIFFERENCES=443
MISSING_TYPE=257
MISSING_MEMBER=184
INTERFACE_MISMATCH=1
OVERLOAD_MISMATCH=1
all other structural/signature/enum/mapping/leak categories=0
ALLOWLIST_SIZE=0
RUNTIME_DIFFERENCES=0
```

The strict verifier exits 1 as intended. Immediate next gates are the coherent math/value group,
differential fixtures, packed consumers/template, and one real CNA backend artifact.

## 2026-08-22: first coherent value/geometry group

The runtime-independent foundation now includes mutable Vector2/3/4, Matrix, Quaternion,
MathHelper, Color packed-vector behavior, Point, Rectangle, Plane, Ray, BoundingBox,
BoundingSphere, and BoundingFrustum. Constructors snapshot struct-like inputs at API boundaries;
array and allocating corner overloads are both exercised.

The verifier learned TypeScript generic type parameters, inferred field types, enum literal values,
and the public structural-interface projection required when CLR uses an explicit interface
implementation. No per-member exception was added. The measured post-foundation baseline is:

```text
REFERENCE_TYPES=257
REFERENCE_MEMBERS=2964
EXPECTED_MAPPED_TYPES=264
TARGET_TYPES=23
TOTAL_DIFFERENCES=450
MISSING_TYPE=241
MISSING_MEMBER=209
all other structural/signature/enum/mapping/leak categories=0
ALLOWLIST_SIZE=0
RUNTIME_DIFFERENCES=0
```

The larger difference total versus the seven-type baseline is expected: a missing type is one
diagnostic, while making it present exposes each still-missing member. The strict gate remains
nonzero and therefore truthful.

Package verification now creates the exact `cna-ts-0.1.0.tgz`, installs it without sibling paths
into fresh JavaScript and TypeScript consumers, executes the JavaScript consumer, compiles the
strict TypeScript consumer with `skipLibCheck=false`, checks all four public package entry points,
and proves `cna-ts/internal/backend` is blocked by `exports`.

## 2026-08-22: canonical template consolidation

`cna-ts-template` commit `d66690a` removes the stale `@openeggbert/cna-js` import, preview package
version, CommonJS/ESM conflict, fake renderer capability probing, three-frame pseudo-smoke, and
decorative Electron/Capacitor dependencies and claims. The identical unused PNG was deleted rather
than misrepresented as XNB content.

The template pins `cna-ts` 0.1.0, TypeScript 5.9.2, and Vite 8.2.2 (whose published Node engine is
`^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`). Its maintained source is TypeScript. `tools/create-project.mjs` emits
either that source or ordinary transpiled JavaScript; the latter has no TypeScript source or
TypeScript dependency. Verification against the exact packed artifact reported:

```text
GENERATED_TYPESCRIPT_BUILD=PASS
GENERATED_JAVASCRIPT_BUILD=PASS
GENERATED_JAVASCRIPT_MANAGED_SMOKE=PASS
LEGACY_OR_SIBLING_REFERENCES=0
```

The canary reports browser bundling separately from native runtime availability. Browser CNA,
Electron, Android, and iOS remain unverified; the exact blocker is still the absent packaged CNA
C-ABI ESM/Wasm artifact.

## 2026-08-22: first XNA differential corpus

A neutral 26-observation JSON corpus now carries XNA 4.0 Windows runtime expected results into
CNA-TS. Finite floats, infinities, and signed zero compare binary32 bits; NaN compares
classification because JavaScript cannot guarantee CLR NaN payload/sign preservation.

The new gate exposed and fixed behavior that tolerance-only tests missed:

- XNA float operation grouping for quaternion multiply/slerp/conversion and math splines;
- fixed-adjugate `Matrix.Invert`, including NaNs rather than an exception for singular matrices;
- `MathHelper.WrapAngle` IEEE remainder and Hermite's infinity-at-endpoint behavior;
- `Color` UNorm round-to-even, midpoint interpolation, packed infinity/NaN handling, and XNA's
  white-with-zero-alpha `Transparent`;
- NaN-aware box comparisons, strict tangent sphere intersection, boundary containment, negative
  radius validation, Ritter-style `CreateFromPoints`, ray epsilon behavior, and near-unit planes.

XNA_DIFFERENTIAL_OBSERVATIONS=26
XNA_DIFFERENTIAL_ASSERTIONS=27
XNA_DIFFERENTIAL_FAILURES=0
```
